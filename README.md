# Deep Learning Specialization Coursera [UPDATED Version 2021]
This repo contains all of my notebooks **the updated version** of Coursera's most famous [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) of 5 courses offered by [deeplearning.ai](www.deeplearning.ai)
Instructor: [Prof. Andrew Ng](www.andrewng.org)

## Updated Assignment Notebooks
This Specialization was updated in April 2021 to include developments in deep learning and programming frameworks. One of the most prominient changes was shifting from Tensorflow 1 to Tensorflow 2.
Most of the old online repositories still don't have solved updated notebooks.
This repo contains solutions of update versions of the notebook (Relevant for 4th & 5th Courses).

## Disclaimer
I recognize the hard time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. The solutions uploaded here are only for reference. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. Please do not copy any part of the code as-is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully). Similarly, try out the quizzes yourself before you refer to the quiz solutions. This course is the most straight-forward deep learning course I have ever taken, with fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure by the deeplearning.ai team.
The reason I would like to create this repository is purely for academic use (in case for my future use). I am really glad if you can use it as a reference and happy to discuss with you about issues related with the course even for further deep learning techniques.

Please only use it as a reference.

Here I released these solutions, which are only for your reference purpose. It may help you to save some time. And I hope you don't copy any part of the code (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully), see the quiz solutions before you start your own adventure. This course is almost the simplest deep learning course I have ever taken, but the simplicity is based on the fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure given by deeplearning.ai team.
