In linear algebra, we say that the 49-dimensional $g_{\\perp}$ is perpendicular (or \"orthogonal\") to $g$, meaning it is at 90 degrees to $g$. The neutralization step takes a vector such as $e_{receptionist}$ and zeros out the component in the direction of $g$, giving us $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$. \n",

    "Next, let's see how debiasing can also be applied to word pairs such as \"actress\" and \"actor.\" Equalization is applied to pairs of words that you might want to have differ only through the gender property. As a concrete example, suppose that \"actress\" is closer to \"babysit\" than \"actor.\" By applying neutralization to \"babysit,\" you can reduce the gender stereotype associated with babysitting. But this still does not guarantee that \"actor\" and \"actress\" are equidistant from \"babysit.\" The equalization algorithm takes care of this. \n",

As discussed earlier, if $g$ were defined by computing $g_1 = e_{woman} - e_{man}$; $g_2 = e_{mother} - e_{father}$; $g_3 = e_{girl} - e_{boy}$; and so on and averaging over them, you would obtain a better estimate of the \"gender\" dimension in the 50 dimensional word embedding space.
